regression analysis of california housing dataset using Neural Network

Several iterations and architecturs of a multi-layer perceptron built and compiled with Keras API and tensorflow back-end.

This is compared against K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm.

The dataset is normalized for use with KNN and MLP to reduce large variance accross many features.
